Both LSF reformulations represent the same failure domain as the traditional binary LSF, while their function values at the safe domain differ; the first LSF quantifies the vulnerability of the most reliable path (RP) between the origin and destination nodes, whereas the other utilizes the shortest path (SP). The paper further proposes a specialized SS to generate network-level fragility curves by connecting intermediate failure events to the earthquake magnitude. The specialized SS can generate the network fragility curve in a single run. The sampling framework is extended to assess k-terminal or k-out-of-N reliability. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework are tested and demonstrated by numerical examples using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo-based SS (HMC-SS). The results confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed network LSFs, as compared to other simulation-based methods directly applicable to binary LSFs. The RP-based LSF has higher accuracy, while the SP-based LSF requires less computation time.</p> <hr> <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3> <p>Various simulation-based and analytical methods have been developed to evaluate the seismic fragilities of individual structures. However, the seismic safety and resilience of a community are substantially affected by network reliability, determined not only by component fragilities but also by network topology and commodity/information flows. However, seismic reliability analyses of networks often encounter significant challenges due to complex network topologies, interdependencies among ground motions, and low failure probabilities. This paper proposes to overcome these challenges by a variance-reduction method for network fragility analysis using subset simulation. The binary network limit-state function in the subset simulation is reformulated into more informative piecewise continuous functions. The proposed limit-state functions quantify the proximity of each sample to a potential network failure domain, thereby enabling the construction of specialized intermediate failure events, which can be utilized in subset simulation and other sequential Monte Carlo approaches. Moreover, by identifying an implicit relationship between intermediate failure events and seismic intensity, we propose a technique to obtain the entire network fragility curve with a single execution of specialized subset simulation. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively evaluate system-level fragility for large-scale networks.</p> <swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true"> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/news/news3_1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/news/news3_1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/news/news3_1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/news/news3_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/news/news3_2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/news/news3_2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/news/news3_2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/news/news3_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> </swiper-container> <div class="caption"> Samples obtained from the (a) entire domain; (b) first subset; and (c) second subset using RP or SP. </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/news/news3_3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/news/news3_3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/news/news3_3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/news/news3_3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> (a) Comparison of generated seismic fragility curves of San Jose highway bridge network; and (b) multi-state network fragility curves obtained by specialized HMC-SS. </div> <hr> <h3 id="acknowledgment">Acknowledgment</h3> <ul> <li>This work is supported by the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) grant funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (RS-2021-KA163162).
